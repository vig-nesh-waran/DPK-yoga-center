    review: "I have been to other yoga centres before, but this has been my best experience so far. Dhaksha is very friendly and also very considerate about everyoneâ€™s health. Best part is she teaches lot of variation . We do asanas, pranayama, strength training using dumbles, meditation and also Zumba sometimes, so we never get bored of exercising.",

    review: "I'm having a great time doing yoga at DPK Yoga Center. Daksha is an incredible yoga instructor and very personable.We do pranayama and meditation in addition to yoga in an open space early in the morning, which adds to the lovely experience. Since I've started doing yoga consistently for the past three months, my sciatic nerve problem and back discomfort have significantly improved. I'm happy I started taking yoga courses here.",
